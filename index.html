    <h2 id="info-section">Website Purpose</h2>
    <p>With all the philosophy content that already exists on the internet, it would be fair to ask what yet another site, from yet another amature philosopher could possibly
    accomplish. There is certainly no shortage of new and interesting opinions, and neither is there a shortage of secondhand analysis on pre-existing works. My goals with
    this site then are neither of those things, but instead to provide me a space to systematize the somewhat random approach I've taken to studying philosophy, as well as
    to offer that beginner level systematization to anyone else who is struggling to find the best way into a very complicated field. I hope to provide a simple, informative
    framework that allows someone to simply create learning plans for the philosophy that interersts them most.</p>
    
    <h2>Some Advice</h2>
    <p>I know I said that I won't be giving any of my personal opinions here, but I couldn't help but give one. For anyone as new to this as I was the single most important
    skill I developped wasn't a stamina for reading difficult papers or quickness with logical argument, but instead an epistemic humility that allowed me to actually learn
    something. The Socrates quote "The ancient Oracle said that I was the wisest of all the Greeks. It is because I alone, of all the Greeks, know that I know nothing" is very
    well known around the world, and I think for a very good reason. The only way that we can actually learn anything is by acknowledging that there is something to learn.
    Though many of us may think of ourselves as relatively smart people already, you will really get the most of philosophy if you can recognize that intelligence doesn't by
    itself grant knowledge, and that there are finite limits on even the greatest human mind.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Philosophy?</h2>
    <p>As I understand it, the study of philosophy is about understanding everything we can about the lives we live. In the past that included both understanding concepts like
      justice or virtue in addition to understanding the physical world around us. In modern times, however, the study of the physical world has broken off into various
      different scientific fields. Fear not though, future philosophers! There are still many questions beyond science worth asking, and plenty of work to be done. The topics
      covered by modern philosophy are generally broken into the following sub categories. You can read a small blurb about each below, and click the link to explore that topic
      in more depth. I hope you enjoy the site!</p>
